### Key Design Patterns

#### Accessibility Pattern
```rust
// All controls follow this pattern
impl AccessibleControl for CustomWidget {
    fn aria_label(&self) -> String
    fn keyboard_handler(&mut self, key: Key) -> bool
    fn screen_reader_announce(&self)
}
```

#### Error Recovery Pattern
```rust
// Structured errors with recovery
enum AudioError {
    DeviceNotFound { recovery: RecoveryAction },
    FormatUnsupported { fallback: AudioFormat },
    // ...
}
```

#### Safety-First Pattern
```rust
// Volume changes always checked
fn set_volume(&mut self, value: f32) {
    let safe_value = self.safety_check(value);
    self.gradual_change(safe_value);
    self.update_indicators();
}
```

### Security & Safety Implementations

#### Volume Safety System
- Maximum volume: 85dB SPL equivalent
- Emergency reduction: Instant to 20%
- Gradual changes: 100ms transitions
- Visual warnings: Color-coded indicators
- Audio warnings: Screen reader announcements

#### Hearing Protection
- Automatic volume limiting after extended high-volume playback
- Visual fatigue warnings
- Recommended listening breaks
- Safe volume presets

## Development Conventions

### Code Standards
1. **No Duplication**: Zero tolerance for `enhanced_*`, `simple_*`, `*_v2` files
2. **Accessibility First**: Every feature must be accessible
3. **Safety Checks**: All audio operations must include safety validation
4. **Error Recovery**: Every error must suggest recovery actions
5. **Documentation**: Inline docs for all public APIs

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all safety features
- Accessibility compliance tests
- Mathematical signal verification
- Performance benchmarks (60+ FPS, <10ms latency)
- Integration tests for audio pipeline

### Commit Conventions
```
feat(accessibility): Add screen reader support
fix(safety): Correct volume limiting threshold
docs(api): Update accessibility API documentation
test(signals): Add mathematical verification tests
```
